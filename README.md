# DuelMasters
This is the source code and resources for a personal project made using Unity. It aims to replicate the trading-card game [DuelMasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_Masters_Trading_Card_Game).

For a brief devlog of the project, check out the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygRrbdPRLQg) where I delve into its key aspects. This video provides insights into the project's goals, development process, and some exciting highlights.

Feel free to reach out if this project has been of any assistance to you as a reference or otherwise, if you would like to discuss game development and design with a fellow practitioner, or if you would like to just make a contact in the field.
