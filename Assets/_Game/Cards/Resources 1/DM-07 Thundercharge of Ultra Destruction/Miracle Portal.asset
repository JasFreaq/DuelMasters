  _rulesText: Choose one of your creatures in the battle zone. This turn, it can't
    be blocked and you ignore any effects that would prevent that creature from attacking
    your opponent. (For example, ignore summoning sickness and card effects that
    say "This creature can't attack" or "This creature can't attack players." Your
    creatures can't attack creatures this way.)
