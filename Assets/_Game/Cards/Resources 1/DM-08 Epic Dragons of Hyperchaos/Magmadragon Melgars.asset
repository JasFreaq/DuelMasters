  _flavorText: Necrodragons slept miles under the swamps. Terradragons hibernated
    at the root of the great waterfall. Magmadragons slumbered in baths of boiling
    rock at the volcanoes' cores. One by one, they awoke, arose, and continued their
    reign of destruction as though millions of years had not passed.
