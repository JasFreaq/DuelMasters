  _rulesText: 'This creature can''t attack creatures.

    Whenever this creature
    becomes blocked, it breaks one of your opponent''s shields.

    Double breaker
    (This creature breaks 2 shields.)'
  _flavorText: Its name is misleading. Mountains tremble in fear at the sight of
    it, and that causes avalanches. What it actually does to the mountains is much,
    much worse.
