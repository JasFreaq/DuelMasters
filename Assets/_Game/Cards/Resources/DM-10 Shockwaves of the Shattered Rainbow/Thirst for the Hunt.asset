  _rulesText: Each of your creatures gets "power attacker +1000" until the end of
    the turn. (While attacking, a creature that has "power attacker +1000" gets +1000
    power.)
  _flavorText: Although illusionary moonbeam weapons are much lighter than stone
    or metal ones, the fact that they vanish in daylight is a bit of a drawback.
