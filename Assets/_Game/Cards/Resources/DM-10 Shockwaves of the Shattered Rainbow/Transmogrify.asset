  _rulesText: 'Shield trigger (When this spell is put into your hand from your shield
    zone, you may cast it for no cost.)

    You may destroy a creature. If you do,
    its owner reveals cards from the top of his deck until he reveals a non-evolution
    creature. He puts that creature into the battle zone and puts the rest of those
    cards into his graveyard.'
