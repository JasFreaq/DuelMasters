    creature is tapped, each of your other creatures has "power attacker +1500."
    (While attacking, a creature that has "power attacker +1500" gets +1500 power.)

    Instead
    of having this creature attack, you may tap it to use its $tap ability.

    $tap
    Choose one of your opponent''s creatures in the battle zone and tap it.'
