  _rulesText: '(This creature is put into your mana zone tapped.)

    Whenever this
    creature would break one of your opponent''s shields, your opponent shows that
    shield to you instead of putting it into his hand. If it''s a spell that has
    "shield trigger," you cast it for no cost, then put it into your opponent''s
    graveyard. If it''s not, your opponent puts it into his hand.
